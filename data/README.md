## IRS Data

Source: [IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-2014-zip-code-data-soi).

* 14zpdoc.doc: explanation of the document
* 14zpallagi.csv: data

Note:
14zpallagi.csv is the original file, but as it is bigger than 100MB, GitHub does not like that, so I split the file in several files, giving us the opportunity to use a "union" as well ;).

## Census Data

Source: [Splitwise](https://blog.splitwise.com/2013/09/18/the-2010-us-census-population-by-zip-code-totally-free/).

* 2010+Census+Population+By+Zipcode+(ZCTA).csv: data
